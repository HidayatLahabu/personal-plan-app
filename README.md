# personal-plan-app
This is a todo app and I'm call it Personal Planing.
This app is build base on tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFsrSEWUQU
In this app, I'm using local storage to save the data
I'm adding backend using https://expressjs.com/ and testing using https://pm2.keymetrics.io/ to run it on my local server
